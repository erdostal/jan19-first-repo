# Homework 1
# My work flow changed about half way through the project when I realized it would be much easier ot separate out maize and teosinte first thing before going any further. This made the fang_et_al file much easier to work with. 
# From there I was able to transpose, sort, and join with snp_cut which had itself been cut and then sorted. 
# Next was to sort out by chromosome column using a for loop Corrinne helped me write wihch also included sorting for chromosome position
# Files were then sorted into four folders: maize.dash, maize.question, teosinte.dash, teosinte.question
